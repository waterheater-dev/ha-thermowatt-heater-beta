# Thermowatt Smart Boiler Bridge for Home Assistant

This add-on allows you to integrate Thermowatt-based smart water heaters into Home Assistant using MQTT. It bridges the gap between the Thermowatt cloud and your local Home Assistant instance.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwaterheater-dev%2Fha-thermowatt-heater)

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track current water temperature (`T_Avg`).
- **Full Control**: Set target temperatures and toggle between Manual/Auto modes.
- **MQTT Discovery**: Automatically creates a "Water Heater" device in Home Assistant.
- **Diagnostic Sensors**: Monitor errors and system status.

## Installation

1. Prerequisite: Install and start Mosquitto MQTT broker within Home Assistant.
2. Click the **Add Repository** button above, or manually add `https://github.com/waterheater-dev/ha-thermowatt-heater` to your Home Assistant Add-on Store.
3. Install the **Thermowatt Smart Boiler** add-on.
4. Configure your Thermowatt account credentials in the **Configuration** tab.
5. Start the add-on.

## Configuration

```yaml
email: "your-email@example.com"
password: "your-password"
```

## Dashboard

Once the add-on is running, a new entity will appear under your MQTT integration. We recommend using the Thermostat Card for the best experience.

## Troubleshooting

The add-on will log each step of its boot cycle, so that in case of a problem, you will be aware of exactly which step failed. A healthy log should look like this:

```code
s6-rc: info: service s6rc-oneshot-runner: starting
s6-rc: info: service s6rc-oneshot-runner successfully started
s6-rc: info: service fix-attrs: starting
